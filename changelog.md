# Integrity-Basic ( v1 )
> Release Date: 09/06/2025

Important Note Before Flashing Integrity Basic v1
```CLEAN INSTALLATION IS MANDATORY```

v5 comes with a lot of major changes, and to avoid conflicts with older versions of the Integrity Basic module, It detects and removes all leftover files from previous installs that could interfere with the latest version.
Once detected, the script will clean up the old files and automatically reboot your device in 10 seconds. (to apply changes)

After reboot, simply flash the same v1 integrity basic module again.
